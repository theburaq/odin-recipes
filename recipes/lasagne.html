        <h1>Lasagne Recipe</h1>

        <img src="../images/lasagne.jpeg" alt="Picture of Lasagne">

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the 
            Bolognese Chamber of Commerce. I've made a couple of 
            changes suggested to me by people from the area, such 
            as which meat and wine to use or if there should be milk 
            added or not. One thing never in question, though, is 
            the green lasagne sheets. These are a must. The ragu is 
            an authentic sauce, simple without garlic or herbs and 
            spices. Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to 
            pre-boil it</p>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <p><li>Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high
                heat until fat has rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add 
                carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook and stir until 
                vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, 
                about 5 minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring 
                and mashing meat into small crumbles, until browned, 
                5 to 7 minutes more.</li></p>
            <p><li>Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. 
                Add tomato sauce and stir; pour in 1 cup broth. 
                Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to 
                allow steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour, 
                stirring occasionally.</li></p>
            <p><li>Pour 1 more cup of broth into the sauce. 
                Continue simmering until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. 
                Add more broth only if absolutely necessary; ragu 
                should drop, not run, off a spoon.</li></p>
            <p><li>Start preparing pasta after sauce has been cooking
                for 1 1/2 hours. Bring water and salt to a boil in a 
                small saucepan. Add spinach and cover until it 
                returns to a boil. Stir gently and cook until spinach 
                is heated through. Remove from heat, leave covered, and 
                let cool.</li></p>
            <p><li>Drain spinach in a mesh strainer set over a bowl, 
                pressing it down with a fork to squeeze out as much 
                water and possible; reserve the liquid. Puree spinach 
                in a blender until smooth.</li></p>
            <p><li>Sift flour into a bowl. Make a well in the center; 
                add eggs, spinach, and about 1 tablespoon of the 
                reserved liquid. Mix together by hand or using the 
                dough hook of a stand mixer, adding more liquid if 
                needed. Knead until dough becomes a smooth ball. Cover 
                with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 
                30 minutes.</li></p>
            <p><li>Taste the ragu and adjust salt. Remove from heat 
                and add milk; stir well and set aside to cool.
            </li></p>
            <p><li>Divide pasta dough into 4 equal sections. Use a 
                pasta machine, or rolling pin, dusted with flour, 
                to roll pasta into 1/16-inch thick sheets. Lay sheets 
                on clean dish towels to help them dry. Let rest for 
                20 minutes.</li></p>
            <p><li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium 
                heat. Do not allow it to brown or burn. Add flour and 
                whisk constantly until golden. Add 1/2 cup milk, 
                whisking constantly. Repeat with remaining milk. 
                Simmer until bechamel is thickened, about 10 minutes. 
                Season with nutmeg and salt.</li></p>
            <p><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li></p>        
            <p><li>Spread a bit of the ragu sauce over the base of a 
                9x13-inch baking dish. Add a layer of pasta. Top with 
                a spoonful of sauce and bechamel. Add a spoonful of 
                grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Top with another layer of 
                pasta. Add more sauce, bechamel, and cheese. Repeat 
                layers until you reach the top; finish with a layer of 
                pasta, bechamel, and cheese.</li></p>
            <p><li>Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is 
                bubbling and the cheese on top has browned, 25 to 
                30 minutes. Let lasagne rest for 10 or 15 minutes at 
                room temperature before slicing.</li></p>
