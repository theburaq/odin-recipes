        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is the essential homemade tomato soup recipe. It's 
            time consuming because everything is from scratch, but 
            very easy to make and easy to customize. You'll need a 
            blender, mesh strainer, and two large pots. If you're 
            cooking for fewer, cut the recipe in half. Top with 
            seasoned croutons, crackers, pumpkin seeds, or feta 
            cheese. The kids like to add Goldfish® crackers. You can 
            be fancy and garnish with basil leaves also.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 pounds tomatoes, halved, or more to taste</li>
            <li>8 cloves unpeeled garlic, or more to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons coarse salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons white sugar, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>4 cups vegetable stock</li>
            <li>½ cup heavy cream (Optional)</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <p><li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li></p>
            <p><li>Arrange tomatoes cut-side up on 1 or 2 large 
                4-sided baking pans. Place unpeeled garlic on top of 
                tomatoes. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with 
                coarse salt.</li></p>
            <p><li>Roast in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove 
                from the oven and let cool in the pan.</li></p>
            <p><li>Meanwhile, heat butter in a large stockpot over 
                medium-low heat. Cook onion, sugar, and oregano in 
                the hot butter until onion is softened, 5 to 7 
                minutes. Peel roasted garlic and add to the pot. 
                Add roasted tomatoes and their juices. Pour in 
                vegetable stock. Cover and let soup simmer for 20 
                minutes.</li></p>
            <p><li>Puree soup using an electric blender working in 
                batches, using extreme caution with hot liquids; 
                vent the lid a bit and cover with a old towel. 
                Force puree through a mesh strainer into another pot,
                discarding solids.</li></p>      
            <p><li>Stir in heavy cream and season soup with salt and 
                pepper.</li></p>       
        </ol>
